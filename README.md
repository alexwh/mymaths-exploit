As of right now all this does is have a broken web viewer and
an sCode generator used for authenticating results of sumbitted
tasks.

sCode is generated with the authCode of the current session (changes
once a day), the taskID, and both scores for each question.

You can pass the result to
/studentRecords/saveDataOH.asp?sCode=&q1score=&q2score=&taskID=
with the appropriate parameters filled in.

Code almost entirely done by [https://github.com/saint1997](saint1997), pushing for him because he is a GitHub n00b.

[https://github.com/alexwh](Yours Truly) worked out the attack vector and worked it into a working exploit manually.
