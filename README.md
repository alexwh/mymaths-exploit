mymaths-exploit: how to use

Step 1: Enter school's username and password below, and click SUBMIT.
Step 2: Enter your ID and password, and click View.
Step 3: Select a task from the list.
Step 4: The task will open in Internet Explorer, copy and paste the address into the task box.
Step 5: Click LOAD TASK, and the task will appear. Enter whatever score you want for each question, then click SET.

The SET button launches the entire exploit - the URL is formatted with the payload and then navigates to the modded URL, which causes the server to return success and save your score.
